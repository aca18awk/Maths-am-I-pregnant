# Maths, am I pregnant?

This is a website that calculates the approximate probability of getting pregnant based on various  factors. The probability is calculated using methods I have derived from quality research (links can be found on the site)

I made this on a whim, however on further reflection I've realised it may actually be useful for someone.

All of the code is here, nothing at all is stored anywhere.
